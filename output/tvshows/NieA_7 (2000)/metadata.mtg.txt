Later, Kotomi tells them that the bath house actually turned a profit.  Genzo shows up with a large load of rice for Mayuko as Chiaki is leaving.  Suddenly, NieA appears in a new UFO she'd been working on in secret.  When the power on this runs out in mid-flight, she lands on the roof of the bath house and blows another hole in it.",
