        "overview": "A brief recap is played at the beginning with Millie being transported to where Kain and Stargazer is. Millie's body is taken over in a sense by Stargazer; he makes her pick up a gun and shoot Kain everytime he moves towards Stargazer. Canal sacrifices herself to destroy Dark Star. All her memories are being erased but she still strives to see Kain one last time. There's a final showdown between Kain and Stargazer. Millie resides at Kain's grandmother's house waiting for Kain to arrive; she falls asleep at a desk writing in a journal and awakens to hear a ship. She bolts up a runs to the window and sees SwordBreaker flying overhead. She runs outside to greet Kain. End credits.",
