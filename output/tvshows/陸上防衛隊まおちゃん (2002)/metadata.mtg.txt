The world's defense has fallen to unlikely straits because the aliens are excessively cute, of which combat engagements are televised: if the forces battling the aliens were not cute themselves, the general public would revolt, as it would be seen as \"bullying\".

They each have a clover-shaped badge that enables them to transform.",
