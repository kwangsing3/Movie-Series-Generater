        "overview": "With thirty minutes left on the clock, Guriko infiltrates the Korai House and heavily damages Meika, putting a stop to her hacking. As Yūta faces off against Guriko, Rabura manages to stop Tsubouchi and exorcise him, allowing Ito and Meika to finish the hacking and launch the missiles and destroy the meteor. Meanwhile, Mikatan decides to activate her power to stop Yūta and Guriko fighting. Before Mikatan is killed by the side effects, Yūta switches bodies with her, returning Mikatan back to Chiyoko's body while he passes away in hers. 49 days later, the Spirit Yūta bids farewell to the others before going back in time to accomplish what he needs to do for a bright future.",

He woke up in a mansion named Koraikan and met a cat spirit named Chiranosuke, who told him “You must find the Sacred Tome of Koraikan in order to return to your physical body.” While searching through corridors of Koraikan, Yūta bumped into underpants of its female residents, and doing so would, eh, create some big trouble for planet Earth.",
