His partner is Chizuru Mizuhara, who through her beauty, manages to gain Kazuya's affection.\n\nBut after reading similar experiences other customers had had with Chizuru, Kazuya believes her caring personality was all just an act to toy with him, and he rates her poorly. Aggravated, Chizuru lambastes him for his shameless hypocrisy, revealing her true pert self. This one-sided exchange is cut short, when Kazuya finds out that his grandmother has collapsed. They dash towards the hospital to find his grandmother in good condition. Baffled by Chizuru's presence, she asks who this girl might be. On impulse, Kazuya declares that they are lovers, forcing Chizuru to play the part. But with Kazuya still hung up on his previous relationship, how long can this difficult client and reluctant rental girlfriend keep up their act?",
