Sora balks at the letter from his crazy dad (\"I found a cool mummy, so I decided to leave it with you, son!\") at first, but the mummy that emerges from inside the huge coffin is a mere 12 centimeters tall--small enough to fit in the palm of his hand... Not only that, it's shy, a crybaby, and most of all, heckin' cute. And so, Sora and ends up keeping the mummy, naming his new little buddy \"Mii-kun.\" But living with a mummy might be easier said than done...!",
