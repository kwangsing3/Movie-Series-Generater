In First High School, the institution for magicians, students are segregated into two groups based on their entrance exam scores: \"Blooms,\" those who receive high scores, are assigned to the First Course, while \"Weeds\" are reserve students assigned to the Second Course.\n\nIn 2095, two siblings enroll in First High School. Upon taking the exam, the prodigious Miyuki is placed in the First Course, while Tatsuya is relegated to the Second Course. Though his practical test scores and status as a \"Weed\" show him to be magically inept, he possesses extraordinary technical knowledge, physical combat skills, and unique magic—making Tatsuya the irregular at a magical high school. Still, He's only interested in just leading a reasonably normal high school life but, because of his abilities trouble appears to go out of its way to find him...",

For magicians, this is normally impossible, since allowing the genes of someone who can use magic outside their home country's borders is tantamount to giving up national secrets. But it's allowed to happen in one case-exchange programs. And that's how Angelina Kudou Shields has arrived in Japan from the USNA to study at First High.\n\nAround the time Lina arrived in Japan magicians began getting attacked by a mysterious being who leaves his victims drained of blood. Will Tatsuya be able to discover the identity of the \"Vampire\"?",
