        "overview": "Yūto is invited to come with the Nogizakas to a ski resort in the mountains. He thinks it is just for them but he quickly finds out the entire class is coming on this trip. While the group enjoys all the hot spring resort has to offer, Shiina sees the trip as an opportunity to express her feelings to Yūto—but in an attempt to hug him, she ends up groping Gento, who was covered in sheets. An enraged Akiho catches them in a compromising position and gets the wrong idea, causing Gento to pass on the group's shrine visitation the next day. The next evening, a blizzard arrives and Haruka goes missing on the top of the mountain. When Yūto, equipped with an insulated polar bear suit, finds her, they both fall down a ridge and become stuck in a cabin. As she is wet and freezing, Haruka takes off her clothes and joins Yūto in his bear suit in just her underwear. However, the two are quickly found not only because the bear suit has a tracking device, but also because the cabin turns out to be just behind the resort.",

    "overview": "Haruka Nogizaka is beautiful, intelligent, and talented at the piano. A true idol of Hakujo Academy. Yuuto Ayase on the other hand is an ordinary guy who, thanks to his hard-drinking older sister and her lecherous friend corrupting his life, has reportedly given up on women. However, one day in the school library, Yuuto stumbles into a rare issue of a magazine catering to anime and nerd culture--or rather, the girl holding it, who turns out to be none other than Haruka Nogizaka herself! Terrified of others realizing that she isn’t as “perfect” as she claims to be, Haruka runs away from Yuuto... but this is one woman that Yuuto just can’t give up on!",
