Overuse of magic is forbidden as it causes mutations which transform the user into violent, uncontrollable and unstoppable monsters.\n\nReiot Steighnberg is a lone wolf tactical sorcerer dedicated to destroying these demons. Armoured and plated in his metal mold, a straight jacket designed to keep him human, he walks a fine line between magic and madness as a rogue monster killer.",
