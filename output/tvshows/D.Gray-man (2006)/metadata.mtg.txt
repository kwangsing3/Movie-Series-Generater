General Cross is sent to Central Office while everyone else must prepare for the relocation of the Black Order's Headquarters. Meanwhile, Krory regains consciousness, much to the joy of his friends. As the Exorcists ponder the significance of Lenalee's evolved Innocence, the \"Crystal Type\", Allen declares that they must become stronger in order to defeat the Earl. The scene changes to show that the Noahs are attending a ball. The Earl is shown in the shadows with a humanoid shape. The end credits show the exorcists continue their duties; reunited with their innocences and sporting new outfits. The post credits reveal the Earl buying flowers from a poor girl with the letters Fin appearing.",
