Many attempts to escape go very wrong. Dokuro makes Sakura chocolate, shaped of himself, for Valentine's Day. However, she adds a special \"binkan sausage\" which makes Sakura really \"special\" and also gives him an allergic reaction. Zansu, Dokuro, and Zakuro then try to help him overcome the allergy, but all are unknown to the fact that Zansu may have a bigger goal in mind.",

    "overview": "In the future, a man named Sakura is destined to create the technology for eternal life, which (due to Sakura's lolicon tendencies) freezes all women's aging once they turn twelve. God refuses to allow this, so he sends his angels to the past to kill Sakura before he can do this. But one angel, Dokuro-chan, decides to try to change the future without killing him. Problem is, Dokuro is very temperamental, and is constantly killing Sakura (and lots of other people too) in incredibly bloody ways with her giant spiked club. Good thing she can bring people back to life - if only to grusomely kill them again the next time she loses her temper.",
