        "overview": "Hades tries to slash Athena, but Ikki gets in the way, getting injured in the process. Believing humans will ruin the Earth further, Hades swears to destroy humanity. Shiryu, Hyoga and Shun arrive and all five Bronze Saints combine their signature moves, but it's useless as they are pushed back, yet Hades is injured. Hades is shocked because Seiya resembles another Pegasus Saint that injured him during the previous Holy War. Hades attacks and shows the Saints the Grand Eclipse is near completion. Everyone thinks hope is all lost, but Seika senses that her brother and his friends won't lose so easily. Suddenly, Seiya and the Bronze Saints are protected by energy spheres, made by Saori, allowing them to return to Earth. Saori awakens, recovering her blood. Seiya hands Athena her Cloth, and once she dons it, she breaks the urn and prepares for the final battle against Hades. Both gods question each other's opinions on humanity, with Saori siding with the humans. Hades moves in for the kill, but Seiya launches his Meteor of Pegasus, injuring Hades further. However, Hades' sword pierces Seiya's chest, rendering him out cold, and his Cosmo is disappearing. Saori, Shiryu and the others mourn their friend's defeat, but Saori questions Hades if he knows what love is, saying how strong it can be. Shiryu and the others come back, burning their Cosmos uniting it with Athena's. Saori's scepter pierces Hades' body, killing him. As Hades' Temple and the Elysium Fields crumble, the Grand Eclipse has been extinguished, with the sun shining again upon the world and its inhabitants. Miho, Shunrei, Julian and Sorrento look up at the sky with joy. Jabu, Ban, Ichi, Nachi, Geki, Marin, Shaina, Kiki and Seika are anxious to see Seiya again. Shiryu, Hyoga, Shun and Ikki carry Seiya's body and return with Saori to a world filled with light, as the Holy War between Athena and Hades has ended, forever.",
