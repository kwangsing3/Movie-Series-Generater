They cross the river surrounding the castle using a raft built from surrounding trees. Ukyou orders Sakon to chase Yoichi's group away. She reluctantly accepts. Yoichi's group enters the castle and sees Sakon standing on the top of a staircase. She reveals that Ukyou plans to marry Ibuki today. Then Sakon's maids attack the party, to which Yoichi successfully blocks. Sakon's use of sleeping gas backfires and causes her maids fall asleep. Yoichi pleads Sakon to return Ibuki. Sakon slaps Yoichi and dissapears. Yoichi's group encounter more guards. Luckily, Washizu, Tsubame, Angela and Torigaya intervene. Torigaya gives Washizu his metal-spiked gloves. Yoichi, Kagome, Chihaya and Ayame chase Sakon into the chapel, where Ukyou is preparing his wedding. Ukyou and Ibuki escapes through a hidden platform. Yoichi follows Ukyou to the rooftop, where they fight each other. Ibuki recovers her memory but falls off the roof. Both Yoichi's group and Ukyou attempt to follow but Ukyou is held back by Sakon hugging his legs. Yoichi's group falls into a river. Yoichi grabs onto Ibuki's breast to stop himself from drowning. Ibuki makes him fly with one punch. Yoichi sent a letter to his father of his wishes to stay at the Ikaruga dojo.",
