While Aono runs away, Yorito is left with an arm missing and he slowly becomes weaker since Aono is losing her Yaka powers. Matsuri tells Yorito to not intervene and goes after Aono. During the fight, Matsuri loses her sword, and Aono takes it up to shove it into Matsuri, but Yorito, not listening to Matsuri's heeding words, intervenes and he is impaled on the sword. Yorito then disappears in a flurry of paper followed by Aono's shrill cries. Matsuri does not hesitate this time to stab Aono and after the sun rises, Matsuri also disappears, but Aono is now human. One year later Aono comes back, and no one but she herself remembers who she is, or any of the incidents that happened. Aono meets with Mana and Koyori and they become friends again.",
