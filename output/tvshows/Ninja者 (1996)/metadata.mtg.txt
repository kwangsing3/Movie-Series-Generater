They are known as Sakura, Matsuri, Yume, Pochi, and Hayashi, and their mission is to sneak inside the Byakuro Castle and steal a secret scroll.\n\nLittle do they know that one of them is the surviving princess, nor are they aware that they are being following. We're sure our young ninja cadets can prove they have what it takes to be full ninja, the only question is whether they can do it before they kill each other!",
