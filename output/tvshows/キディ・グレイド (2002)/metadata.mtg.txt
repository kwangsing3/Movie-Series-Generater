Ã‰clair offers all of her energy to LumiÃ¨re, who then uses that power to destroy the left side of the Deucalion. With its main weapon destroyed, the remaining ships make short work of what's left. Dvergr joins her daughter as she dies, and Ã‰clair looks on as Chevalier dies from his own wounds. In the end, Ã‰clair and LumiÃ¨re return to GOTT to continue the fight for galatic peace!",
