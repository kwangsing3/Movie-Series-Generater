        "overview": "Sen blindly pursues the cursed spirit as it arrives at the Academy with Hanzo sacrificing herself to protect Sen. Distraught, Sen is also killed as she remorses over Hanzo's body. Both are absorbed by the spirit as Yukimura, Matabei, Sasuke and Kanetsugu continue to fight. They are also killed and absorbed one by one as Muneakira, Jubei, and Keiji arrive to witness their absorbtion. Muneakira attacks the spirit only to be saved by Keiji as he is hit. Enraged Jubei enters into the spirit meeting with Inko who tells her she wishes to die by Jubei's hand and that it is possible as Muneakira is still alive. Within the Academy, Yoshihiko is informed that the spirit will arrive seven minutes before the Chingo Stone's barrier is complete. Keiji pours her ki into Muneakira telling Jubei that while everyone else believes that the Samurai Bride is monstrously powerful, she believes that a Samurai Bride isn't.",
