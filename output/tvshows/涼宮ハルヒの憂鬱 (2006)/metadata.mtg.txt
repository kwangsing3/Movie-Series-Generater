        "overview": "Deciding Yuki needs a familiar for her role, Haruhi picks up a stray cat and names it Shamisen. However, when Haruhi leaves that day, Shamisen starts talking as a result of Haruhi's powers. Itsuki suggests that they need to remind Haruhi her movie is a work of fiction, before reality takes any more damage. The next day at school, Mikuru gives him a coupon for her class's yakisoba café, and gives her views on Haruhi that she couldn't say in front of Itsuki. Kyon later talks with Yuki, who throws up the idea that one of them, including herself, may be lying. As shooting resumes, Haruhi's powers to continue to make Mikuru a deadly weapon. Itsuki calls Kyon out later that night, asking him to find a way to hold back Haruhi's powers. Kyon convinces Haruhi to add a disclaimer at the end, saying the film is a work of fiction, and the rest of the shooting goes without a hitch. Kyon falls asleep whilst editing the movie, only to find it has edited itself overnight. At the very last of this episode, there is a flashback to May that Kyon tries telling Haruhi that Yuki, Mikuru and Itsuki are actually aliens, time travelers and espers, but she doesn't believe him.",

Claiming to be interested in only aliens, time travelers, and ESPers, Haruhi Suzumiya was the strangest girl I've met in a long time... Before I knew what's going on, I've been dragged into her weird club, and it looks like I'm not the only one who has been drafted into this \"SOS Brigade\" of hers, because there are three other students who don't seem to be so ordinary themselves.",
