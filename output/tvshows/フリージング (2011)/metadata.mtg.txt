        "overview": "Chiffon fights Amelia's Nova in attempt to protect the photon generator and her fellow comrades Satellizer, Rana, Kazuya and her Limiter Eugene. She lands some blows to Amelia but the Nova's armor quickly repairs and protect its core. Chiffon further transforms herself to increase her strength. Amelia's Nova delivers a powerful energy beam but Chiffon manages to nullify its attack. During the fight, Chiffon and Amelia converse each other within their subconscious and Chiffon decides to protect her comrades and suggests to stop the attack while Amelia agrees on Chiffon's suggestion but her emotions completely took over her and the attack is unavoidable. With the assimilation of Type Maria's power to Amelia's Nova, Amelia further transforms her Nova into a powerful self-destructing core and Chiffon decides to sacrifice herself in order to prevent annihilation. After Chiffon's successful absorption of Amelia's attack, her aura spreads throughout the Alaskan laboratory putting Pandoras to tears and realizing it came from Chiffon's love. Even Chiffon's aura reaches to Ticy, which she tells Ticy that she would be the successor of becoming President on their organization. In the aftermath of Amelia's Nova attack, Oohara was hospitalized and Spencer was taken to custody. Kazuya returns to Japan to be with Satellizer and Rana, but afterwards they see a new Ticy Phenyl with hair length same as Chiffon and the ribbon being tied to her right part of the hair walking somewhat grieving due to Chiffon's death.",

    "overview": "Eager to follow in the footsteps of his fallen sister, Kazuya enrolls at West Genetics Academy, a training facility for buxom heroes known as Pandoras. These courageous schoolgirls are genetically-enhanced with enough sex appeal to cripple a man – and the superhuman strength to slaughter aliens by the dozen. Kazuya’s role is that of Limiter, a Pandora’s battle partner, and he quickly sets his sights on the most feared beauty in school, Satellizer el Bridget. This full-figured annihilator of aliens is as desirable as she is deadly, but rubbing her the wrong way could lead to gross bodily harm. Can Kazuya forge a bond with his new partner and rise to the top of the ranks at West Genetics? Or will he fall victim to the mysterious bloodlust lurking within Satellizer?",
