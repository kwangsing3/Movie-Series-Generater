        "overview": "Mirei steals Chifuyu's ability when she uses it to protect Hatoko, before Tomoyo helps everyone to escape. Regrouping at a karaoke box, the group deduce that the Mirei they fought against was an imposter possessing her body. Jurai goes by himself to confront the imposter, tricking her into stealing his enhanced \"Dark and Dark of the End\", which only serves to burn its user's hand with a neverending flame that cannot be extinguished. This forces the imposter to return Mirei to her body, after which they use Chifuyu's powers to chop off the burning hands and send them to another dimension whilst Sayumi heals them. Following the incident, Tomoyo and Hatoko discuss their respective feelings for Jurai, before everyone returns to their everyday lives.",
