        "overview": "Now embodying the will of Earth itself, the wastefully energetic Poemi uses her new powers to literally tear through the alien mecha (passing salarymen and one copulating couple within it along the way), pursue her career as a voice actress (loudly referred to nine  or ten times), and right wrongs as she sees them throughout the planet. Being wastefully energetic, however, the cure is worse than the disease! Sending a nuclear missile off-course, completely destroying an entire country that speaks in vegetables, breaking the neck of an otaku playing a very mature, sexy computer game, which includes nude girls, porn...And all that pukish stuff... (\"Playing pervy games starting in the afternoon is also evil! I mean, those are for nights!\" – Poemy) prompts less angst for Poemy than awaiting a pager message from K which never comes. For that matter, the Aasu sisters don't take too kindly to a new magical girl horning in on their family business, sinecure though it was! A brief confrontation between Poemy and the sisters leads to them discovering her identity (and another impressive group bath); this takes the strain off, but when the alien invasion's final phase – a giant Death Star en route to destroy the planet – suddenly begins the next morning and the sisters are captured and Poemy's first voice actress job is rudely interrupted, it is up to Poemy to rescue them from the clutches of the very boy she has a crush on.",
