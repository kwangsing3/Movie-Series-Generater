In response, Nanaka locks herself in her room and refuses visitors, and Sana visits every day in an attempt to talk to her. One day, Sana finds Nanaka in the bath with her wrist cut, and he manages to have her brought to a hospital.

Ten years later, everyone returns to see a concert performed by Nanaka. Before the concert, Sana proposes to Nanaka, who accepts. For the concert, Nanaka plays the finished version of the song she wrote for Sana when she was younger titled \"Myself ; Yourself\". Shusuke and Shuri attend the concert though unexplained on their return.",
