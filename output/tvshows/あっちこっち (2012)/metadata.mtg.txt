The following day, they come together at the Inuis' place where their teacher Kikue Sakuragawa, who seems to be Miiko's friend, is also present. They talk about new year's resolutions, play games, and have a meal.\n\nPart B: It's a very cold day. Due to a flu epidemic, more than half the class is absent, school finishes after lunch. Tsumiki and Io appear to have a 'moment' which leaves Io rather confused and flustered.",

    "overview": "Tsumiki Miniwa, a small girl who packs a punch, is in love with her best friend, tall and easygoing Io Otonashi. The only problem is that she can't bring herself to come out and say it. And, despite the fact that he can otherwise read her like a book, Io doesn't seem to be able to pick up the obvious clues—even with all of their friends teasing that there's no one better suited for each other.\n\nAcchi Kocchi follows Tsumiki and her circle of friends as they go through their day-to-day lives. Between Mayoi the electronics nerd, Sakaki the good-natured prankster, and the nosebleed-prone Hime, Tsumiki's friends will never let her live down her crush. But only time will tell if Tsumiki will gain the courage to finally say how she truly feels.",
