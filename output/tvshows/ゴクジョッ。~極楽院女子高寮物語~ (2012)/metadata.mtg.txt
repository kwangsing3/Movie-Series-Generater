She's arrogant, believes her bra is a fashion accessory that's meant to be worn in public, and takes out her aggression on her closest friends – especially poor Konatsu, who is frequently picked up and spun around by her ponytail. Together with her friends, Aya enjoys an action-packed, event-filled high school life, whether she's trying to steal the panties her friends are wearing or secretly trying to film her classmates' underwater!",
