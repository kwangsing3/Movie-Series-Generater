Futilely, he tries to speculate on the origin of the Gate, but is abruptly cut off when a flying Remnant gets too close and destroys the helicopter. On the ground, people stare in awe, overwhelmed by a feeling of helplessness. Exhausted, Hazumi struggles to climb up the side of the Gate. \"Wait for me, Takumi! Don't die!\" she screams.",
