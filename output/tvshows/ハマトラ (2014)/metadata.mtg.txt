        "overview": "The episode begins in a flashback showing Nice, Art and Skill's time in Facultas. When Skill was confirmed to have the potential to develop a Minimum, he was not seen by his friends. Art discovers that Facultas was forcing Skill to use his Minimum to make others receive Minimums regardless of what happened to others. As a result, Skill begged his brother to kill him which he did in shock. Art lost the memories of that event until being nearly killed by Moral. Momoka then revealed Art his brother did not entirely die just as he met him. The episode then moves to the present where Momoka kills herself bored with the world. Nice is revealed to have survived Art's attack. He faces Art in rage because of what he did to Hajime. In the middle of the battle, Skill's battle appears using his Minimum to restore everybody's Minimum. After being defeated, Art jumps from the building in order to kill himself. The next day, Nice, Murasaki and Hajime visit Skill's grave and are approached by Art. Nice punches him claiming that if he commits suicide again he will kill him. In the epilogue, Nice and his friends celebrate Art's return to Nowhere.",
