        "overview": "Brady is at first upset about being placed in a mechanical body against his will, but soon comes to grips with the fact that what's done is done and also that he can be a great force for good in the world. Hardly grown accustomed to his new powers he smashes a table to pieces when he strikes it, Prof. Genius guides him and explains the many things he is capable of because of his superior electronic brain which responds much faster than a human brain. Super-speed and reflexes allow 8th Man/Brady to capture a bat in mid-air. Infrared vision allows him to see in the dark, and special plastic skin gives him the uncanny ability to transform his appearance anyway he desires.",
