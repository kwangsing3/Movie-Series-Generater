Makina knows she doesn’t belong among the living, but that won’t stop her from unleashing the full fury of her twin MAC-11 machine guns on the rotting remains of those who refuse to die. She’s hell-bent on filling every empty grave she can find with the monsters that should be six feet under. Makina is a Shikabane Hime — a Corpse Princess — and it’s her job to finish off the undead leftovers haunting the dark corners of a city that used to be safe.",
