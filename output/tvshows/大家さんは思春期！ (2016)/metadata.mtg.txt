In his tiny, no-bath apartment he is visited by Chie Satonaka, who looks like the little sister he never had, but turns out to be the landlord of this apartment building. Chie's high degree of competence when it comes to cooking and housework, sometimes makes her appear very much older than the middle school girl she actually is. Maeda-san's other neighbour, Reiko Shirai, quite jealously tries to guard the cute landlord for herself though. And so Maeda-san's otherwise uneventful life, supposedly living alone, suddenly becomes quite lively...",
