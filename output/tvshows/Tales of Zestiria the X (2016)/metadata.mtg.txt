        "overview": "Sorey Armatizes with Zaveid, Edna, Mikleo, and Lailah, using all of their powers in an ultimate Armatization form in a final battle against Heldalf, who had become a monstrous beast. IN a hard battle, Sorey is able to defeat Heldalf, releasing him from the monstrous form, but he still remains the Lord of Calamity. The Malevolence uses the beaten Heldalf as a hollow vessel to use. Sorey promises to free him from this fate and attacks again, plunging the two of them into underground river. He sends the Seraphim away so he can fight him on his own. This sacrifice seems to have worked as the Malevolence has stopped and lowered to near non-existent levels around the world. Maotelus proclaims that this is the first time to truly purifying the world. Their battle done, everyone goes their separate ways. In the years that followed, Alisha becomes Queen of Hyland and brokers a peace treaty with Hylance. Lailah is revered by the people of Ladylake and the surrounding countryside, leaving on another adventure with a new Sheapard. Edna has become a Lord of the Land, with Zaveid serving as her bodyguard, and Eizen, who had regained some semblance of humanity with the lowered Malevolence. Rose and Alisha remain close friends. Mikleo is still exploring the world but receives a telepathic contact from Sorey. Mikleo finds Sorey alive and well, revealing that he was able to Purify Heldalf and left him in a far-off country town that was unaffected by his rampage. He and Mikleo decide to head home, hitting up whatever ruins they can find along the way.",
