The four set out on a journey to stop the experiment to revive Gyumaoh.\n\nOn the way, they meet Hazel Grouse, who employs strange magic that uses yokai souls to revive the dead, and his follower Gato.

And Ukoku Sanzo, a man they have a long history with, approaches in the shadows...\n\nUnforgettable characters, intense personal drama, and awesome action in a story about the bonds between four men!",
