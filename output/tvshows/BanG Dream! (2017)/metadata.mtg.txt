Before Poppin'Party's performance, Rimi confides to her band that she is hesitant to play as the finals symbolize the end of their journey up to that point. However, she and the band are uplifted when they hear the crowd recite their pre-performance chant. Poppin'Party and Roselia perform new songs, while RAS play a rendition of Chiyu's birthday song. The audience votes for the winner, with Roselia claiming the Grand Prize; to the others' surprise, RAS receives the Best Performance title while Poppin'Party is named Best Band. The three bands close out the event by playing their collaboration song.",
