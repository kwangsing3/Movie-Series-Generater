Together with Kasumi Tonime, who joined the alien fighter simply for the sake of doing so, and Kumi Kawamura, who became and alien fighter to avoid the responsibility of yet another year of class presidency, she must defend her school from periodic alien attacks. Introspection, fear, anxiety and friendship await Yuri as she is forced to stare life itself in the mouth in her chaotic coming of age.",
