        "overview": "Angelina, Airi and Sakuno see what they think is Pannya around town, but soon realize that it was in fact Pannya's mother. The Nuko Club members go to where Miu first met Pannya and see Mamanya (Pannya's mother) and another smaller Pannya-like animal with her. The club members realize they have to let Pannya go back to its family, though this weighs heavy on Miu most of all. Airi is inspired by Miu, who can still smile despite having to give Pannya up, to help the school merger succeed, and organizes a student rally for the cause. Miu tries to be overly happy towards Pannya, but breaks down in the club room and cries on Shingo's shoulder. After talking with her mother, Miu finally resolves to let Pannya go back to its family. The club members go to the forest clearing where Miu met Pannya and it is reunited with its family after the club members say goodbye. Time passes, and in the spring the school merger has been completed. After Miu graduated, Sana becomes the club president.",

    "overview": "When boys suddenly get into places where they've never been allowed before, some girls tend to get upset. So when the decision is made to merge the elite Yuihime Girls' Private Academy and the coeducational Kagamidai Private Academy, everyone wants to take extra care in avoiding trouble while bringing the two Privates together. Therefore, rather than just bringing the Kagamidai boys into the Yuihime girls' school all at once, a plan is concocted in which a group of test males will be inserted into the Girls' Private Academy first.\n\nThus, poor young Shingo finds himself being thrown as a sacrificial lamb to the lionesses of Yuihime, who aren't exactly waiting for him with open arms. Will Shingo manage to survive the estrogen soaked death pit that is Yuihime? Can the girls learn to be more receptive to the boys? And just how long until something involving panties will cause emotions to flare, sparks to fly and the battle of the sexes to explode?",
