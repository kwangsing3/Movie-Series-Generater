Left with no other choice, Rimuru finishes Clayman off. With Clayman dead and Carrion and Frey announcing that they're stepping down as Demon Lords, the total number of Demon Lords including Rimuru is reduced from ten to eight. Guy coerces Rimuru into coming up with a new name for their group, and Rimuru's solution is \"Octagram,\" representing each of the Demon Lords as an eight-pointed star. Thus a slime became one of the eight Demon Lords, marking the start of a new age.",

One day, he falls victim to a random assailant on the streets and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind which the dying man cannot make sense of.\n\nHe regains consciousness only to discovers that he has reincarnated as a slime in another world. He has also acquired newfound skills—the power to devour anything and mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the Catastrophe-level monster \"Storm Dragon\" Veldora who had been sealed away for many years. Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in destroying the seal. In return, Veldora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant him divine protection.\n\nNow, liberated from his past life, Rimuru embarks on a new journey with a distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.",
