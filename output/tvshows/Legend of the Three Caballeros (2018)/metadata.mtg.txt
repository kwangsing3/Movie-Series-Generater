The Caballeros try to fight Felldrake but are overpowered and pushed to the verge of defeat. In their last moment, they are contacted by Blazebeak, an ancient wizard whose power had been protecting them through their amulets. With his power, the Caballeros attempt to banish Felldrake back into his staff, but Sheldgoose destroys it out of panic and inadvertently restores everything to normal. His true nature exposed, the boardmembers strip Sheldgoose of his presidency and Donald is named the new Acting President to everybody's happiness. As Sheldgoose escapes on Leopold, he finds that Felldrake is now trapped inside his own body, and Felldrake decides to call in a favor from an \"old friend\"",
