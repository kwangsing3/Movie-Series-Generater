While the whole city is rejoicing, Sapphee ends up catching a cold, possibly from letting her guard down after they finished the surgery. Glenn takes a lot of care in taking care of her and Sapphee uses this chance to let him dote on her. Later on, Glenn has to make a house call, and ends up running into Skadi and Kunai on his way, as well as some others he had treated in the past. They all give Glenn thanks and give him various gifts. He ends up bringing back all of the food and alcohol he had received, and they have a huge party back at the clinic.",
