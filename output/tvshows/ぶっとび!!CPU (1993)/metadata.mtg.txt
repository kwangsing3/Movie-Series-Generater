So when the Model 9821 finally goes on sale, he races to the store only to discover that it sold out in just 5 minutes! Yet, as luck would have it, Akira also manages to stumble across a man who just happens to be willing to sell him the exact model he was looking for! Unfortunately, Akira doesn't look close enough at the packaging. Instead of the 9821, he ends up with a Model 2198 - a super-advanced, biomechanical computer girl named Mimi!",

He then finds what he thinks is the same model number in an alley, and buys the large boxed-up machine from a shady character nearby. When he gets home, Akira is shocked to find that his new computer is a bio-android shaped like a pretty young lady. He is even more shocked when she tells him that she constantly needs his semen to refresh her physical memory.",
