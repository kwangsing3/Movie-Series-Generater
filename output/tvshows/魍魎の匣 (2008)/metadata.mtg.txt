After Suzaki took Kanako's head, Amemiya killed Suzaki and ran away with the head. Kubo met Amemiya on a train and saw Kanako's head alive inside the box. Kubo tried to keep the heads of other girls alive in a box for himself. Before he killed Yoriko, she told him about Mimasaka. Kubo wrote about it in \"The Woman inside the Box\", then went to Mimasaka, who performed the same procedure on Kubo. Mimasaka's project of implanting a human brain into a machine began when he tried to treat Kinuko's myasthenia. Mimasaka treated Kubo as simply another research subject. When the police try to arrest Mimasaka for what he did to Kubo, he grabs the box with Kubo's head and tries to escape with Yōko. Kubo bites Mimasaka in the neck and kills him, leading Yōko to kill Kubo. Kiba arrests Yōko for the murder of Kubo.",
