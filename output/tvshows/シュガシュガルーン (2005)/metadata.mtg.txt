Instead, she gives it to Chocolat because she thinks that Chocolat will be a better queen. Chocola and Vanilla wish to study further in the human world; Queen Candy permits them to do so. Then Pierre and Chocolat get married in the Magical World, making Chocolat the first queen of the Magical and Ogre worlds. Pierre now doesn't collect noir, he collects pink and orange hearts.",
