    "overview": "Honjou Kaede is invited by her friend Shiramine Risa to play a virtual reality MMO game with her. While Kaede doesn't dislike games, what she really, truly dislikes is being in pain. She creates a character named Maple, and decides to put all her points in VIT to minimize pain. As a result, she moves slowly, can't use magic, and even a rabbit can get the best of her. But as it turns out, she acquires a skill known as \"Absolute Defense\" as a result of her pumping points into VIT, as well as a \"Counter Skill\" that works against special moves. Now, with her ability to nullify all damage, she goes on adventures.",

Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis doesn't end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills. After only a few days of playing the game, Maple claims third place in a server-wide event, gaining a reputation as a player. Despite her overpowered character, Kaede has much to learn. As she progresses through the game, she meets new friends. Through all of her adventures, she may even pick up some other crazy skills that exceed all expectations.",
