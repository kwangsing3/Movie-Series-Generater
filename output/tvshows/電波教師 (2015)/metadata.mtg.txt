As a NEET, he's devoted himself to his anime blog and nerdy collecting habits. He claims he has a serious illness called \"I can't do anything I don't want to do.\" Desperate to get him to do something with his life, his little sister manages to get him a job teaching physics at his old high school. He's certainly an unconventional teacher, but he becomes fairly popular with the students. After helping a girl who's being ruthlessly bullied, Kagami finds that he actually likes teaching. Will he continue his career as a weird teacher? Will he go back into physics? Or will he end up back where he started?",
