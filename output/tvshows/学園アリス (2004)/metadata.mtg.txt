So when Hotaru suddenly transfers to Alice Academy, a prestigious school in the city, her best friend is devastated—especially when she hears of the horrible rumors regarding the academy's harsh treatment of students. Beset with worry, Mikan runs away to see her best friend!\n\nUpon her arrival, Mikan learns of \"Alices,\" individuals gifted with various supernatural abilities, and that the school is an institution built by the government to train and protect them.
