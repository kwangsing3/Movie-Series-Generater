Forced to kneel down and apologize to Tokuchi to avoid exposing the team's cheating, the Lycaons are able to continue and win the game. However, the victory is just another step to achieve Kojima and the Lycaons' goal to win the championship.",

There, he meets Toa Tokuchi, a 134-kmph pitcher and the undisputed king of a gambling form of baseball called \"One Outs\". At Kojima's urging, Tokuchi signs up with the Lycaons under an unusual contract: he gets 5,000,000 yen for every out he pitches, but loses 50,000,000 yen for every point he gives up. A high-level psychological game of baseball, gambling and logic is about to begin..",
