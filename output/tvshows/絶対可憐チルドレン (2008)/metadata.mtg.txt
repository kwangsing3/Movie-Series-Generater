        "overview": "An opulent party aboard an oceanliner that P.A.N.D.R.A. swiftly commandeers in its perpetual avarice for finance and infantry sets the stage for Mio to wonder about Kaoru and her teammates whose emphatic exhortations for a trip to the beach are consistently met with an abrupt but paternal »Schoolwork first!!!« repulsion from Minamoto while The Hound special esper team is busy assisting the police in trying to apprehend an esper that misunderstands what a gift his Level 5 powers are. Considering the difficulty Hatsune is having and how much she hates homework, Kaoru is only too happy to leap into action with her teammates. The injunction against excessive force along with counsel to corner the fugitive firmly in mind, Kaoru and her teammates chase the perpetrator into a tunnel and intercede for him against an oncoming train; a rousing inspirational speech later, the perpetrator reneges on his suicide threat and capitulates. The epilogue is a collage of scenes depicting the immediate future of several people. Kaoru, Shiho, and Aoi have all graduated from elementary school while Naomi has graduated from high school into being a college student. Keiko is charged the supervision of Barret and Tim as special espers. The P.A.N.D.R.A. espers driving each other bananas while Kyousuke drinks tea obfuscates Chisato and Touno's encounter with Yuri already dressed in the school's uniform either having been purified by the Collaborative Deluge or is simply an excellent actress while she waits to be wielded by Black Phantom. Kaoru is sent on another mission with her teammates adorned in their new mission uniforms.",

    "overview": "They're cute, adorable and three of the most powerful Espers the world has ever seen: Kaoru, the brash psychokinetic who can move objects with her mind; Shiho, the sarcastic and dark natured psychometric able to pick thoughts from people's minds and read the pasts of inanimate objects like a book; and Aoi, the most collected and rational of the three, who has the ability to teleport herself and the others at will. So what to do with these potential psychic monsters in the making? Enter B.A.B.E.L., the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory, where hopefully \"The Children\" and others like them can become part of the answer to an increasing wave of psychic evolution. It's a win-win solution... Unless you're Koichi Minamoto, the overworked young man stuck with the unenviable task of field commanding a team of three pre-teen girls!",
