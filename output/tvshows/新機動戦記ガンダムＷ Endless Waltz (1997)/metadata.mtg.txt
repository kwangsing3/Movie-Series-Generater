Duo, Trowa and Quatre get their Gundams back and help Zechs and Noin in their attack on the Mariemaia Army's captured fortress in Brussels. Heero eventually arrives, having convinced Wufei that they must bring an end to the conflict, and uses the Wing Zero's twin buster rifle to destroy the fortress' underground bunker shields. When the people of Earth arrive to declare their own desires for peace, Relena and Lady Une are able to convince Mariemaia that she is mistaken. Dekim tries to kill Relena, but is instead killed by one of his own soldiers out of respect for Treize. Following Mariemaia's surrender and the return of peace between Earth and the colonies, the last of the mobile suits (including the Gundams) are destroyed. The Gundam pilots are at last able to bring closure to their lives as soldiers.",
