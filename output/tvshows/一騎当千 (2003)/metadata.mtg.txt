To pay for the travelling expenses — to be able to visit these tournaments — she got a job, to earn enough money to make her dream come true.\n\nLittle did Hakufu expect that new allies and enemies would detract from her goal. Or that she might even be considered a weak leader in the eyes of her companions. To top it off a sister suddenly appears, making it painfully obvious to Hakufu that she does not really know much about her mother's past.",

However, there is no rest for the weary as a figure stirs from within the site of the battle...\n\nAt the same time, another figure stands before the gates of Kyoushou. Upon closer inspection, it turns out to be a high school girl with a ponytail, wearing a jersey and toting a rucksack. She smashes aside all Kyoushou fighters who try to stop her. Occupying the academy's P.A. room, she issues her challenge: \"I am Ryoushuu's Bachou Mouki! Fight me, Sousou Moutoku!\"\n\nThe peace won at Chibi is short-lived. Despite the recent setback, Sousou Moutoku is fast recuperating his power. In addition, a new faction arises in the form of Nanban High School.",
