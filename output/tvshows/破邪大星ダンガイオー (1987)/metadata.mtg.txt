        "overview": "The Dangaioh Team travels to Latecia, Roll's home planet to assist the resistance group's war on the Bunker, but Roll is haunted by fragments of his past. Roll reunites with the resistance, who are not thrilled with his return after having disappeared years ago. After the masked mercenary Skeleton convinces the resistance to trust Roll, they plan to storm through the Bunker's base, which uses captured soldiers as lifeblood of a bio-mechanical computer. Meanwhile, Dr. Tarsan reveals to the rest of the team that Roll was previously murdered by members of the resistance; hence his fear of death. Upon arriving at the Bunker base, Roll discovers that he has fallen into a trap set by his former comrades Burst and Flash, along with Skeleton-who reveals himself as Gil Berg. Using Roll as bait, Gil requests for Mia to meet with him alone to spare her teammate's life. As Gil tortures Mia, Roll conquers his fear of death and breaks free to save her before they regroup with the Dangaioh Team. Dangaioh kills Burst and Flash in a mecha battle before destroying Commander Dartilla and the Bunker base, but Gil emerges in the Gil Gear and attacks Dangaioh and severely damages Dr. Tarsan's ship. A critically damaged Dangaioh uses its remaining power to destroy Gil Gear with one final Psychic Wave. Dr. Tarsan fires a warp beam to teleport Dangaioh away before he goes down with his ship. Gil survives the battle and is promoted as one of Captain Galimos' generals. Elsewhere, the four cockpits of Dangaioh with their unconscious pilots are seen drifting in space.",
