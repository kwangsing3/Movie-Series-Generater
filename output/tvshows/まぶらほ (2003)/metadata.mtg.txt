In the end, Kuriko suggested that she would take around six Kazukis all for herself and the remaining four will be given to Rin, Yuna, and Chihaya. Yuna disapproved as she is (or so she believes) Kazuki's wife and she would consider it unfaithful should any of the ten Kazukis date another girl.",

    "overview": "High school student Kazuki Shikimori comes from a line of powerful magicians with extraordinary DNA and he attends the most prestigious school for wizards in all of Japan. It would seem that life is good for Kazuki. Unfortunately, that couldn’t be further from the truth. He’s not the most smooth when it comes to the ladies, his grades are poor, his athletic skill is next to none, and to top it all off, he can only use his magic eight times before he turns into dust! However, three magical hotties have learned of his genetic secret and are all after him! Suddenly he has become the most “popular” kid in class. Are all these girls out to romance him, or are they only after his DNA?",
