    "overview": "The Summer of \"Anu\": In a summer once every five years, demons in  the mysterious Tower of Druaga lose their powers due to the magic spell  cast by a god named \"Anu\". King Gilgamesh, ruler of the kingdom Uruk,  uses the appearance of demons as an excuse to invade the tower and find  out the construct's secrets. As 80 years passed, the Uruk army managed  to fight back the demons and built a fortress city and safe haven on the  very first floor of Druaga—Metz Kier. Thus begins the story of a  warrior named Jil, who, finding companions along the way, embarks on a  quest for the fabled Blue Crystal Rod, a powerful artifact rumored to be  in the highest floor of Druaga. However, other competitors, including  the kingdom of Uruk itself, want the treasure, all for their own  reasons.",
