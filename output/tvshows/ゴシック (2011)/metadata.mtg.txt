        "overview": "After trying to kill Victorique, the Brian Roscoe who was with her fell from a cliff and was seriously injured, while his brother died holding Cordelia's hand. He was saved by her and taken to the port where they are found by Grevil who had orders to capture them, but let they escape instead. In a boat leaving the country, Brian states to Victorique that Cordelia was the kind of mother he and his brother always wanted, and was envious of Cordelia's love for her. Begging her to keep living for her mother's sake, he passes on. Victorique's hair turns silver due to everything that has happened this however proves to be in her benefit when two officers stationed on the boat she is travelling on remove the habit she is wearing, because the order to arrest her stated she had long blond hair they let her go thinking they had made a mistake. She is then approached by Jupiter Roget bringing Kujo's letters to her. After the war ends, the academy is reopened, Grevil,who had now payed his debt to Victorique sports his old hairstyle again. Jupiter Roget then appears before Sauville's king and tells him of how the queen's maid had saved her by taking her place and dying for her. After this, the king begs Jupiter to work with him again. Avril is seen on a beach presumably near her home, she sends a letter in a bottle on the waters, hoping for a miracle that it reaches Kujo and Victorique. To her annoyance, the bottle is washed back ashore. Ambrose is also seen reading a book about the Monstre Charmant. after reaching the end all the mythical characters in the book wave good bye before being sucked into a strange door. Which then fads into the background of the picture in the book, the picture looks much like Saubrème after the fire caused by Brian and Cordelia symbolising that the old ways of the kingdom of Sauville went away in the fire and a new dawn has come. In Spring of 1929, Kujo, who has grown his original hairstyle back, returns safely to a war-torn Japan to reunite with his family and with Victorique, who had been living with them after finding clues as to where to find them and using the letters from kujo (as well as the information he had already told them about her) to prove her identity. Kujo and Victorique are then reunited and both state that no matter how the world changes, they will always be together and they seemingly lived happily ever after.",
