The show takes place in a Japanese school where everything is normal, except for students from what are called \"specified races.\" The specified races are based on yōkai from Japanese mythology; for example, one student on the swim team is a kappa, while another, a nurikabe, merges with walls and is popular in the summertime for having a very cool temperature.",
