        "overview": "The girls soon realize they have gone back to the beginning of the previous day, which Yuka sees as a second chance to try and pass the audition, though it once again ends in failure. Later that day, they discover a shrine from the same family as Rinko's which has its own wishing rock and soon realize it has granted their wish for a never-ending summer vacation, which is proven when they end up looping the day over and over again. As they continue to loop, they forgo the audition and instead opt to try various other activities. After deciding they need to find a way to cancel the wish, Yuka theorizes that they may be able to escape the loop if they pass the audition. Although they manage to get through the audition, they still end up looping come midnight. Rinko then realizes they need to say goodbye to the miracles the wishing rock grants them. After spending one more day in Tokyo, the girls finally enter the next day.",
