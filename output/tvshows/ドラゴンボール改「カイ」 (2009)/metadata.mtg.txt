But as the match goes on, he learns more and more, and more and more of his hidden power is released until he is able to go toe to toe with Goku in his base state (without Goku powering up). When Goku does power up slightly (in his normal state) Uub nearly falls out of the ring, but Goku saves him from hitting the ground. He realizes that Uub doesn't even know how to fly, so Goku decides to train him. Despite his friends and family pleading with Goku to stay, he flies away with Uub on his back. Goku decides to train Uub to defend the Earth when he's gone. He hopes one day, when Uub's training is complete, to have a real all-out match with him to test their power. Goku and Uub fly off into the distance with whoops of joy.",
