        "overview": "The ambiance is intense as the audience awaits Creamy Mami's arrival so that the concert can get underway; upon seeing the audience population tabulation, Shingo is overjoyed as he recalls his entire prologue with Creamy Mami who wishes a solo concert much to his shock as he wonders why Mami feels the need to rush her professional career. The frustrated Megumi ironically becomes the deus ex machina that enables the concert to begin in earnest; amid short-circuiting electrical equipment that gives Shingo cause to suspend the concert, Creamy Mami sings with everything she has even though she knows the outcome along with Posi and Nega as Toshio feverishly searches for an apparatus to test his hypothesis that Yuu and Creamy Mami are one and the same. Just as Mami prepares to sing the final song, the Feather Star's descent for a landing clearly visible to everybody sets the stage for Mami to have explained to her that the deal is over especially since Toshio has remembered everything. After contributing special effects to complement Mami's final song as a final parting gift, Pino-Pino gets underway with Posi and Nega as he tells Yuu he is not hostile to an occasional visit before depositing her right where Toshio can escort her home.",
