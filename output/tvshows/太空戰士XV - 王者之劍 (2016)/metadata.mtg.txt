He charges at it alone, and after a fierce battle is beaten back - during the fight, he remembers everything about the first attack, including how his father only managed to drive it away. Noctis finds new resolve in these memories, and kills the Daemon with help from his companions, which causes him great emotion. The four then return to their road trip to Altissia.",
