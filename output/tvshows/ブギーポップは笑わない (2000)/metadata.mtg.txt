Indeed, as the manticore is still alive; it possessed the writer when the manticore was originally destroyed by Boogiepop Phantom.  Boogipop comes and destroys both the manticore and the writer, who had actually died a long time ago.  Boogiepop then says, \"\"I feel sorry for Toka Miashta.  She was supposed to be taking an entrance exam now.\"\"  Thus the series comes to the end, with us only just knowing who Boogiepop really was.",
