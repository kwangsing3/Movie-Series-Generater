        "overview": "Chizuru wants Kouta to say he loves her, but he is very hesitant. Chizuru tries several methods to make him say it, but gets frustrated. Tayura asks Akane out on a date and she accepts, but says she wants to go to an art gallery instead of usual popular date spots like an amusement park. Kouta admits that he loves Chizuru in the end when he spots her crying in the rain on the bridge where they first met. Kouta and Chizuru become lovers, and Nozomu barges in saying that she accepts their relationship, and that she in turn will be Kouta's mistress, a thing which to Kouta's dismay Chizuru accepts.",

    "overview": "Kouta has girl troubles of the supernatural sort. For some reason, he keeps attracting the attention (and affections) of animal spirits!\n\nHaving spent most of his life in the country, Kouta is understandably nervous when he moves in with his grandma to attend a high school in the big city. He hoped to make a good impression, but having Chizuru, a beautiful fox spirit, hanging off his arm didn't seem to be the sort of image he wanted to have. She's not alone in her love for Kouta, either. Nozomu, a wolf spirit, as well as other youkai have their sights set on the hapless country boy.",
