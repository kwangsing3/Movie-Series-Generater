Arashi asked Hajime if anything happened, though Hajime does not recall doing anything. Kaya was actually trying to find a moment to get back at Hajime for making her drink the “Cutie Cherry Fruit Juice.” Kaya starts making something with the Kiwis that Sunglasses brought in, but Hajime and Arashi follow in taking strange actions.",

One day he entered a store and met Arashi, a beautiful sixteen-year-old girl working there. After trying to protect her from a man who claims to have been hired by her family to take her back by force, Yasaka ran away with her and now she stays at his grandpa's place with him. It didn't take much time for Yasaka to figure out that his new friend is far from an ordinary girl, as she possesses mysterious powers. The plot thickens when he finds a sixty-year-old picture of Arashi and another girl named Kaja, and to the surprise of all Kaja suddenly appears, and just like Arashi, her appearance hasn't changed at all since then.",
