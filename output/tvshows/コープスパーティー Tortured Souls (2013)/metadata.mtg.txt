        "overview": "Ayumi tells Satoshi and Naomi that in order to return home, they must appease Sachiko and perform the Sachiko Ever After ritual again using their paper slips. Ayumi confronts and vanquishes Naho after realizing she purposefully lied about how to properly perform the ritual in her blog. Ayumi later encounters Yui, who is decapitated by falling debris. Exploring the school basement, Naomi finds a video of herself hanging Seiko while possessed; she breaks down until Seiko's spirit relieves her. After the trio put Sachiko's spirit to rest, the school begins to collapse and the trio begin the ritual. Satoshi gives his slip to Naomi, who had lost hers, and intends to use Yuka's slip for himself, unaware that it is actually Yuuya's. Naomi and Ayumi both successfully return to Kisaragi Academy, but because Satoshi used a slip belonging to someone from a different school, only his detached arms come with them. A post-credits scene shows Naomi catatonic in her room, her mother disbelieving the existence of her dead classmates.",
