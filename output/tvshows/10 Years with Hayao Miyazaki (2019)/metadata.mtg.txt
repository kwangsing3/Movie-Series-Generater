        "overview": "An exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at legendary Japanese animator and director Hayao Miyazaki. For a decade, he allowed a single documentary filmmaker to shadow him. At age 72, he takes on a new challenge - one that would become the highly-acclaimed \"The Wind Rises\" (2013), Miyazaki's first film about a historical figure. Bringing the film from concept to reality turns out to be a long and difficult journey. In the process, Miyazaki grapples with tough questions about issues like aging, and the meaning of making animated films in a turbulent time.",
