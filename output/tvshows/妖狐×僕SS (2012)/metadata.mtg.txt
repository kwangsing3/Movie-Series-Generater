Zange invites Watanuki and Karuta to join and eventually everyone else joins in too, as well as Ririchiyo, who recounts how she was when she first arrived at Ayakashikan to how she is now. While Kotarou thinks of what to write, he is comforted by his father, who states that the him who has not met Kotarou or his mother is not him at all. As they bury the time capsule. Sorinozuka notices that Ririchiyo accidentally placed a letter written to Miketsukami into the time capsule. Realizing that she accidentally switched a letter to Miketsukami from the one meant for her future self, which stated she will not run away and stay by Miketsukami's side, she runs off to Seijou Park. After talking with Miketsukami over the phone, while he goes to fetch her, Ririchiyo realizes that Miketsukami hates himself like she was before, but she was able to overcome the ordeal because she fell in love with Miketsukami. Knowing she has hurt others to protect herself, she decided to use her courage to save Miketsukami by confessing to him and Miketsukami embraces Ririchiyo stating that he too loves her. The ending credits shows separate clips of certain scenes in the manga and ends with Miketsukami revealing that his only dream is to have a child and a family.
