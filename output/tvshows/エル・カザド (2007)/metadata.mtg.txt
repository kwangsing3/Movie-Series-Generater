Having become accustomed to the lifestyle, Nadie finds herself as happy as ever, though Ellis senses that she misses life on the road. After an unexpected visit from Blue Eyes, the two girls find themselves along with Blue Eyes and the middle-aged couple being held up by the two transvestites (now quite obese) from earlier episodes seeking revenge. After dispatching the thugs, despite an offer to stay where they are, Ellis and Nadie decide that their place is on the road and the two drive off seeking their next adventure.",
