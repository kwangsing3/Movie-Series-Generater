        "overview": "Many years ago, Cross Marian brought a younger Allen to a caretaker when he fell into a trauma after attempting to revive his guardian Mana and turning Mana into an Akuma. As Cross took care of Allen, Allen recovers but starts behaving like Mana. In the present day, after abandoning the Order, Allen returns to his caretaker. Sheril continues torturing Lavi to know the truth behind Road's past and her relationship with Nea. At the same time, Kanda returns to the Order to make peace with the dying Zu, the scientist who launched the Second Exorcist Project. While synchronizing with his Innocence, it turns into a crystallized form. Later, Kanda reveals to Marie and Lenalee that he only returned for Allen as a self-redemption for awakening the 14th. Elsewhere, Allen starts fighting Akuma who react to his transformation into Nea. When Allen starts to transform again, he remembers Mana's and Cross's words of encouragement, which allows him to regain his body.",
