As a small sampling of the insanity, Excel and Hyatt (the former more deranged than usual, the latter more sickly than usual) switch bodies, Cosette returns only to get naughty with Dr. Shioji, Watanabe takes Hyatt (in Excel’s body) to a love hotel, Nabeshin gets married, and there’s way too much blood and pointless violence. What better way to end a \"Quack Experimental Anime\"?",
