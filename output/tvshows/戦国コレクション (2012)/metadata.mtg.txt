Nobunaga soon engages in battle with Yoshimoto, who uses the river to her advantage, and is also confronted by Soun. As Nobunaga is outnumbered, Mitsuhide arrives to even up the odds and the two team up to defeat Yoshimoto and Soun. As Nobunaga claims Yoshimoto, Soun and Sessai's secret treasures, Mitsuhide steals them from her, stating she plans to collect the other remaining secret treasures to prevent Nobunaga from leaving her alone. As Nobunaga happily gives chase after Mitsuhide, Soun reunites with Jun whilst the other generals have fun enjoying their new lives.",
