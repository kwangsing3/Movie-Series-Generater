But God became afraid of the Human's unlimited potential, so he divided the world into two and sealed them apart. One world of magic and one world of science.

Akazukin and Val, a silver wolf, came from the magic-world to prevent her from that.  A grand story of a boy who will lead a checkered life and girls in fairly lands has just begun.",
