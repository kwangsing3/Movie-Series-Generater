As the Digimon make their way through the silent city, they stumble upon a pack of Goblimon, led by an Ogremon, who are attacking a young girl. They scare off the goblins, and the girl, Rhythm, reveals that she is actually a Digimon, then explains that the thorns are the work of a Digimon named Argomon. The quartet sets out to confront the villain atop his skyscraper lair.",
