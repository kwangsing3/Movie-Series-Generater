The answer to that mystery begins to surface as Lupin and his crew embark to Egypt to steal a stone artifact from a pyramid. Fujiko, Lupin's would-be love, double-crosses Lupin and steals the stone, lured by the promise of eternal youth and beauty by the mysterious scientist known as Mamo. Her actions lead Lupin into an international chase of a greater scope and danger than he has ever faced.",
