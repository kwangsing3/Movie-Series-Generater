    "overview": "Some 120 million years ago, a king named Satan fell to hell and instigated a rebellion against gods, all kinds of confusion and evil effects began to occur on earth. El Cantare, the highest existence of Earth, allowed a part of his spirit to descend on Earth to put an end to the realm of Hell. El Cantare's consciousness descended to the continent of Mu, to Atlantis, to ancient Incan Empire, to Greece, and to India as Gautama Siddhartha and awakened people with the power of enlightenment.",
