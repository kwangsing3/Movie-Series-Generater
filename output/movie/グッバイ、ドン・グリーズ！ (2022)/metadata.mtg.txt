But when he meets Toto, they become a duo, naming themselves \"DonGlees.\" Eventually, Toto was supposed to move out to Tokyo for school, but on the summer of their first year of high school, they meet Drop, a new addition to DonGlees, who invites them to \"view the world from above.\" When Roma and Toto follow Drop, they become involved in a forest fire that gets blamed on them, and go off in search of a missing drone that has evidence of their innocence. A small incident becomes an important, life-changing journey that culminates in Iceland.",
