    "overview": "Nishiyama Hiyori is a really shy and short (only 140cm tall) 15-year-old girl, who had been hospitalized for a whole year, due to a car accident. Now that she returns to school, she wants to quickly adapt to the new surroundings.  Just when she was about to introduce herself to her new classmates, a boy named Hirose Yuushin (190cm tall) walks in. He is open and always happy, quite in contrast to her shy and quiet being. Sitting next to each other and thanks to his personality, Hiyori slowly loses her shyness.",
