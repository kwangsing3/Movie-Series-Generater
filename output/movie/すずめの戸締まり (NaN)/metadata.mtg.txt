As if drawn in by something, Suzume outstretches her arm to the door…  One after another, the door starts to open up to various different places in Japan. But, due to misfortunes falling upon those on the other side, this door must now be closed.  The stars, and the sunset, and the sunrise.  In those places that she gets lost in, as though all of time had disappeared, and guided by a strange door, this is where Suzume’s journey of closing doors — “Tojimari” —  begins.",
