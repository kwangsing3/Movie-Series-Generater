    "overview": "Karasuno High enters the Inter-High Volleyball Tournament and immediately proves they're \"flightless crows\" no more. After their first match, Karasuno dukes it out against Date Tech High and their famous Iron Wall, which shut down every spike of Karasuno's ace, Asahi, during a previous match. Karasuno, however, breaks through the Iron Wall this time and proceeds to the Round of 16. The newly rejuvenated Karasuno fights Aoba Johsai High and seeks to have the same outcome as their first practice match.",
