    "overview": "Sumikkogurashi debuted in 2012 as slightly negative characters who like to stay in the corner of a room. The characters include \"Shirokuma\", a polar bear who is sensitive to cold, \"Penguin?\" (with a question mark in its name), a penguin who is unsure if it is actually a penguin, \"Tonkatsu\", a piece of pork cutlet that was left uneaten, \"Neko\", a shy cat, and \"Tokage\", who hides his nature as one of the last dinosaurs.  The franchise has inspired toys, books, stationery material, video games—and now a feature film.",
